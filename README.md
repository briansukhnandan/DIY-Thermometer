Another project I had been putting off for a long time, but I needed a way to continuously monitor the temperature
in my room.

I decided to create a thermometer with an Arduino, DHT11 Humidity Sensor, and a 16x2 LCD screen to display output.

# What I learned #

- How more components of the Arduino work such as an LCD monitor and the DHT11 Humidity Sensor.
- More about setting up complex circuits and debugging hardware.
